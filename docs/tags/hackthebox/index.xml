      <description>Introduction Laser Machine is rated as Insane level machine created by MrR3boot &amp;amp; r4j and was released on HackTheBox Platform. This machine is based on exposed features of Printer to gain initial foothold.
Enumeration We used -sC for using Defualt script and -sV for Service Version Scan. After Nmap we can see that machine has three running ports that is port 22, port 9000 and port 9100. We know that port 22 is used for SSH and we can also see that in Nmap.</description>
